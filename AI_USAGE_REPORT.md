# AI Usage Report

This project leveraged AI tools to accelerate development, improve code quality, and streamline documentation. Below is a summary of how AI was integrated into the workflow.

## AI Tools Used
- Primary AI tools: GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT
- Key use cases:
  - Generating React and Next.js components
  - Creating Tailwind CSS styles and dark mode support
  - Writing and updating documentation (README, usage guides)
  - Refactoring code for best practices and accessibility
  - Providing troubleshooting and debugging suggestions

## Prompts 
1. "Add dark mode support to the FAQ section."
2. "Create a responsive hero section with a call-to-action button."
3. "Write a simple contact form with validation."
4. "Make the navigation bar sticky on scroll."
5. "Add animation to the testimonials section."
6. "Improve the mobile layout for the pricing section."
7. "Update the README with setup instructions."
8. "Fix the bug where the FAQ answer does not collapse."
9. "Suggest color palettes for a creative agency website."
10. "Refactor the code to use reusable button components."

## AI vs Manual Work Split
- AI-generated: ~70% (Initial component scaffolding, styling, documentation drafts, code refactoring)
- Manual coding: ~30% (Custom logic, content updates, project-specific tweaks, bug fixes)
- Customization: AI-generated code and docs were reviewed, edited, and adapted to fit the project's branding, requirements, and user experience goals.
